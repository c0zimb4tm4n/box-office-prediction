# box-office-prediction
A tool that aims to predict box office revenue of hypothetical movies based on the cast and crew.

## Project Type:
Tool

## Question of interest:
We seek to build a web tool that should be able to predict the box office revenues, with resonable accuracy, of hypothetical movies based on a hypothetical cast and crew.

## Goals:

1. Develop a tool for predicting box office collections of hypothetical movies.
2. Utilize two datasets: one containing data of over 5000 movies with complete cast and crew details, and another with their respective box office information.
3. Train a machine learning model on these datasets to understand the correlation between cast/crew composition and box office success.
4. Enable users to input a desired cast and crew for a tentative movie.
5. Use the trained model to predict the potential box office collection of this hypothetical movie.

## Data Set:
1. IMDb and Box Office Mojo Movie/TV/OTT Data (Bulk Data SAMPLE) (AWS Data Exchange Product)
2. IMDb Essential Metadata for Movies/TV/OTT (Bulk Data SAMPLE) (AWS Data Exchange Product)
